        "* We also need a way to identify readmissions. Let's assume a calculated column `DaysToNextAdmission` was added to the `Fact_Encounter` table in the Gold layer (or we will create a DAX measure to approximate this). For simplicity, a readmission is defined as a subsequent hospital admission for the same patient within 30 days of the discharge of a previous admission.\n",

        "        * Click the ellipsis (...) next to the dataset name and select **\"Security\"**.\n",
        "        * You should see the `Clinic Manager` role.\n",
        "        * Add members (users or security groups) to this role. For example, add `manager_clinicA@healthforward.com` to the role. When this user logs in, their `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` will be `manager_clinicA@healthforward.com`. The DAX rule needs to handle this. If the DAX is `[AssignedClinicID] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()`, then you'd add users to the role whose UPN *is* the clinic ID (e.g., add \"ClinicA\" as a member if that's what you tested with, though UPNs are typically emails).\n",
        "        * *For the DAX `[AssignedClinicID] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()` to work directly in service, the users assigned to the \"Clinic Manager\" role would need their UserPrincipalName to exactly match a value in the `Dim_Patient[AssignedClinicID]` column.* This is often simplified for labs. In reality, a mapping table (e.g. `UserSecurity` with `UserEmail` and `AssignedClinicID`) is joined in the model and used for RLS.\n",

        "**Discussion Questions:**\n",
        "1.  **What are the benefits of using DirectQuery mode for Power BI reports connected to a Fabric Lakehouse, especially with DirectLake datasets?**\n",
        "    * **Real-time or Near Real-time Data:** DirectQuery (and especially DirectLake) means Power BI queries the data directly from OneLake each time the report is interacted with. This ensures the report reflects the latest data without needing scheduled refreshes of an imported dataset.\n",
        "    * **Handles Large Datasets:** There's no need to import potentially huge datasets into Power BI's memory, as the data remains in OneLake. This allows analysis over very large volumes of data.\n",
        "    * **Single Source of Truth:** Data isn't duplicated. Everyone accesses the same underlying data in OneLake, reducing inconsistencies.\n",
        "    * **Performance with DirectLake:** DirectLake specifically reads Delta Parquet files directly from OneLake into memory for querying, offering performance comparable to Import mode but with the benefits of DirectQuery for data freshness.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **If clinic managers dispute the readmission numbers, what steps would you take within Power BI and Fabric to trace the data and validate the calculations?**\n",
        "    * **Review DAX Measures:** Double-check the DAX formulas for `Readmissions (within 30 days)` and `Readmission Rate` for logical errors or misunderstandings of the readmission definition. Use DAX Studio or Power BI's performance analyzer to examine the queries generated.\n",
        "    * **Validate Input Data in Power BI:** Create a table visual in Power BI displaying the raw `Fact_Encounter` data for a few disputed cases. Include `PatientKey`, `AdmissionDate`, `DischargeDate`, and the `DaysToNextAdmission` column (or the columns used to calculate it). Manually verify if the readmission flag/calculation is correct for these sample cases.\n",
        "    * **Trace Back to Gold Layer Table in Lakehouse:** Use the Lakehouse SQL endpoint to query the `Fact_Encounter` table directly (e.g., `SELECT * FROM HealthDataLH_YourName.dbo.Fact_Encounter WHERE PatientKey = 'some_disputed_patient_key' ORDER BY AdmissionDate`). Verify the underlying data matches what Power BI is showing and that the `DaysToNextAdmission` column was calculated correctly in the ETL.\n",
        "    * **Trace Back to Silver/Bronze Layers:** If discrepancies are found in the Gold layer, trace further back to the `Silver_Unified_Encounters` table and then to the Bronze tables (`Bronze_HL7_Encounters_Raw`, `Bronze_FHIR_Encounters_Parsed`) to see how the raw source data was transformed. This involves checking the Spark notebooks or Dataflows used for ETL.\n",
        "    * **Check Lineage in Purview:** Use Microsoft Purview (if configured) to visualize the data lineage from the source systems through Bronze, Silver, Gold, and into the Power BI dataset to understand transformations and dependencies.\n",
        "    * **Data Profiling:** Use Fabric tools (e.g., in Notebooks or Dataflows) to profile the source data for anomalies, missing values, or data quality issues that might affect the readmission calculation.\n",
        "    * **Clarify Definitions:** Reconfirm the exact business definition of \"readmission\" with stakeholders (e.g., what types of admissions count, exclusion criteria) and ensure the logic aligns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Beyond `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`, what other DAX functions or techniques could be used in RLS to handle more complex security scenarios (e.g., user belongs to multiple departments, hierarchical roles)?**\n",
        "    * **`USERNAME()`:** Similar to `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`, returns the username.\n",
        "    * **`CUSTOMDATA()`:** Allows passing a custom string value when the user connects (often used with embedded analytics or specific connection configurations). This string can contain role information, department IDs, etc.\n",
        "    * **Security/Mapping Tables:** The most common and robust approach is to include security tables in your Power BI model.\n",
        "        * **User-to-Attribute Table:** A table mapping users (e.g., UserEmail) to the attributes they can see (e.g., `UserAccess[UserEmail]`, `UserAccess[AllowedClinicID]`). The RLS rule on `Dim_Patient` would then be `[AssignedClinicID] = LOOKUPVALUE(UserAccess[AllowedClinicID], UserAccess[UserEmail], USERPRINCIPALNAME())` or by establishing a relationship from `Dim_Patient` to `UserAccess` (filtered by UPN) and letting relationship filtering apply.\n",
        "        * This easily handles users belonging to multiple departments/clinics if the mapping table has multiple rows per user or a list of allowed IDs.\n",
        "    * **`CONTAINSROW()` or `IN` operator with a table:** If a user can see multiple clinics, the RLS DAX expression might check if the `Dim_Patient[AssignedClinicID]` is present in a list of clinics the current user is allowed to see (derived from the security table).\n",
        "        * Example: `CONTAINSROW(FILTER(UserAccessTable, UserAccessTable[UserEmail] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()), UserAccessTable[AssignedClinicID], Dim_Patient[AssignedClinicID])`\n",
        "    * **Path Functions for Hierarchies:** If you have organizational or geographical hierarchies (e.g., Region Manager > Clinic Manager), DAX path functions (`PATH()`, `PATHCONTAINS()`, `PATHITEM()`, etc.) can be used on a dimension table that defines the hierarchy. RLS rules can then filter based on whether a user's position in the hierarchy (or an entity they manage) is within the path of an employee or department.\n",
        "        * For example, a role on `Dim_Employee` might be `PATHCONTAINS(Dim_Employee[EmployeePath], LOOKUPVALUE(Dim_Employee[EmployeeID], Dim_Employee[Email], USERPRINCIPALNAME()))`.\n",
        "    * **Role-Playing Dimensions & `USERELATIONSHIP()`:** If security depends on context provided by different relationships, `USERELATIONSHIP()` can be used within `CALCULATE` in the RLS filter to activate specific relationships.\n",
